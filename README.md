 Go to Azure Portal ( https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us) and sign in.                                 






 <h4> ‚Ä¢ Create a New VM:  </h4>                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                    
‚Ä¢Navigate to the "Virtual machines" section and click on "Create" and after that "Virtual machine".                           
‚Ä¢ Fill in the necessary details like subscription, resource group, VM name, region, etc.                                             
‚Ä¢ Select Debian as the operating system image.                                                                                   
‚Ä¢ Choose the appropriate size for the VM based on the expected load.                                                                  
‚Ä¢ Go to the additional options like disks, networking, management, and advanced settings.                                    
                                                                                                                            <h4> ‚Ä¢ Networking Setting  </h4>  
                                                                                                                            
‚Ä¢ Ensure that the network security group (NSG) attached to the VM's network interface has a rule to deny all inbound traffic 
  which you can adjust based on your network policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 ‚Ä¢ Make sure on allowing specific ports that are necessary for the honeypot operation and management.                                                                                                                      
 <h2> Step 2: Install and Configure the Honeypot</h2>
 
<h4> Access the VM:</h4>

 ‚Ä¢ Once the VM is set up, obtain its public IP address from the Azure portal.
‚Ä¢ Open Putty and connect to the VM using its IP address .

<H4> Install Honeypot Software:</H4>

‚Ä¢ After accessing the VM via SSH, update the package list: sudo apt-get update                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                            ‚Ä¢ Install any required dependencies for the honeypot software.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                            ‚Ä¢ Clone the AzureSentinel-Honeypot repository or download the latest release to your VM.                                                                                                                                                               
‚Ä¢ Navigate to the downloaded or cloned directory: cd AzureSentinel-Honeypot.                                                                                                          
‚Ä¢ Follow theSpecific instructions to complete the installation of the honeypot.

<h2> Step 3: Verify Installation</h2>

<h4> Start the Honeypot Service: </h4>

‚Ä¢ From within the project directory, start the honeypot service. This could be through a script or command specific to the honeypot you are using.                              
‚Ä¢ Ensure that the service is running correctly and listening on the specified ports.

<h4> Test the Honeypot:</h4>

‚Ä¢ Run an attack or use a testing tool to verify that the honeypot is capturing and logging activities as expected.

<h4> Step 4:Post-Installation Setup </h4>

‚Ä¢ Configure any additional settings for monitoring, alerting, or integrating with Azure Sentinel for enhanced security analytics and threat management.
